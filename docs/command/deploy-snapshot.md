# Deploy Local Build

## Description

The `deploy-snapshot` command validates a local folder and uploads its contents to an S3 bucket.
:::warning
The deploy snapshot command cannot deploy to production S3 buckets.
:::
:::info Metadata Support in Uploads
This command supports **S3 object metadata** using `.meta.json` files.  
If a file has a matching **`<filename>.meta.json`**, its contents are used as metadata  
and automatically prefixed with `x-amz-meta-`. The metadata JSON itself **is not uploaded**.

s3-cli deploy-snapshot --folder-path <FolderPath> --bucket <BucketName> --prefix <Prefix> --target-server <TargetServer>
```

This command will connect to ECS S3 if a target server is not provided.
