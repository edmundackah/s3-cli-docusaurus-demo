# Deploy Release Build

## Description

The `deploy-release` command downloads a `.tgz` file from a specified URL (Artifactory), 
validates a change record with ServiceNow and uploads the contents of the `package/build` directory to an S3 bucket.
:::warning Mandatory Change Record
A valid change record is required to run this command against a production bucket.
:::
:::info Metadata Support in Uploads
This command supports **S3 object metadata** using `.meta.json` files.  
If a file has a matching **`<filename>.meta.json`**, its contents are used as metadata  
and automatically prefixed with `x-amz-meta-`. The metadata JSON itself **is not uploaded**.

## Usage

```sh
s3-cli deploy-release --application <Application> --version <Version> --bucket <BucketName> --prefix <Prefix> --change-record <ChangeRecord>
```

This command will connect to ECS S3 if a target server is not provided.
